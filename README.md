# Animated Zalgo Text

Because why not?

The contained script is used within an old [blog post](http://bdero.me/blog/animated-zalgo.html).

TLDR;
To use:
First, include the script anywhere in your page (header or not):
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://bdero.me/animated-zalgo/hecomes.js"></script>
Note: If your site uses an SSL certificate, you should host it yourself because I'm currently not. Most modern browsers reject mixed content by default out of concern for user privacy.

Next, add an element (or multiple elements) to the page with a class of "hecomes". For instance, a div:
  <div class="hecomes" style="display: block; height: 10px;">Screwed up text!</div>
